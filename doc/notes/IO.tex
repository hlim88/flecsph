\section{I/O}
Large-scale simulations require an efficient, parallel and distributed I/O.
We base this first implementation on HDF5 file structure with H5Part and H5Hut.
The I/O was developed at LANL and provides a simple interface to read and write
data in H5Part format.
The first requirement is to allow the user to work directly with the Paraview
visualization tool and splash\footnote{Describe it! url too}.
